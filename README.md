# LendingClub_NN
Utilising past data on loans with information on borrowers' ability to pay off the loan or being Charged Off, a model can be made to predict if a borrower can pay back their loan. This model can be used for future customers to assess their ability for loan repayment and could aid in deciding if a loan should be provided.

Due to the large size of the csv it was not included in the project files. The notebook can be displayed here if github displays errors viewing: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ShadabShaikhEng/LendingClub_NN/blob/main/keras_lendingclub_project.ipynb
